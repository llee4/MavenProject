# How to Create your Maven Package

1. Open the IDE of your choice (in our case, IntelliJ) and create a new Maven project.
2. Make sure to create it in a new empty folder, an change the organization, as this will be the one under which all the files will be packaged.
3. Now, look at the fiels on your left. The pom.xml is the main Maven file. It tells Maven what exactly your project is and what else is required to build it.
4. Create a new class inside the src/main/java folder. This is where your code for the packaage will go. The test folder is used for writing unit tests.
