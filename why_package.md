#Why package your code? What is it and what does it do?

Packaging your code is an essential step in making it more usable. Instead of having to clone a repository every time you want to use one of its functions and then going in and tediously changing your code base, packaging allows you to import repositories and make calls to them easily and without hassle. In short, integrating a packaged repository is infinitely easier than trying to implement classes directly.
