# How to Upload your Finished Package to the Central Maven Repository

1. If you have not already, [make a Sonatype account](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa)
2. Open a [New Project Ticket](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?issuetype=21&pid=10134) with a title and description and a link to your project (for this project the Project URL would be https://github.com/llee4/MavenProject and the SCM URL would be https://github.com/llee4/MavenProject.git with the .git to point to version control)
3. The radio button selection asks "Already Synced to Central" -- usually this answer will be no, unless this package has been previously added to the Sonatype Open Source Software Repository Hosting
4. Make sure that your pom.xml file matches the example one in this repository, as well as the settings.xml file.  In either of those files, replace the information within angle brackets to be specific to your own repository.  For example, change groupId to the developer name (make sure this stays consistent throughout your project) and change artifactId to your project's name.  Also, put your personal information (such as jira username and password) into the settings correctly.  Here are all of the requirements for the pom.xml and settings.xml, from Sonatype themselves:  https://central.sonatype.org/pages/requirements.html  Make sure to add the project url and scm url from your project to the pom.xml file where asked.  
5. Go back to your terminal and cd into the repository.  Then, use the command mvn clean deploy, and hopefully you should receive the message "build complete."  In a couple hours you should be able to find your project on the central maven repository.

This is an excellent video that summarizes this process:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxP9IuJbcDQ&t=14s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxP9IuJbcDQ&t=14s)
