# How to Upload your Finished Package to the Central Maven Repository

1. If you have not already, [make a Sonatype account](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa)
2. Open a [New Project Ticket](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?issuetype=21&pid=10134) with a title and description and a link to your project (for this project the Project URL would be https://github.com/llee4/MavenProject and the SCM URL would be https://github.com/llee4/MavenProject.git with the .git to point to version control)
3. The radio button selection asks "Already Synced to Central" -- usually this answer will be no, unless this package has been previously added to the Sonatype Open Source Software Repository Hosting
